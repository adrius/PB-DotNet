=========

C# tool to parse and analyze PowerScript (Powerbuilder) source code.

Disclaimer
=========
I started this project to find a good way parsing and analyzing PowerScript source code. PowerScript has very good capabilities analyze object structures but most of these operations are very slow. So I decided to take the .NET way.

TODO
=========
* Use correct Icons for objects in list
* Complete syntax highlighting
* Open every object in it's own Document tab
* Append funcions and events to object list (?)
