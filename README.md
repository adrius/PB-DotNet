C# library to parse and analyze PowerScript (Powerbuilder) source code

Disclaimer
=========
I started this project to find a good way parsing and analyzing PowerScript source code. The main criteria were performance and not to use PowerBuilder itself, because of some limitation by this platform. 

Meanwhile PowerBuilder isn't my major development platform anymore. So i decided to bring this to open source. If a PowerBuilder developer enjoy this and find some new creative ways to extend this framework, let me know ;)
